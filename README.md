# steep.js
This is a Cartesian coordinate system named steep.js made with p5.js (https://p5js.org/) by me :). If you are interested give it a try :).
This program got 4 functions (colored diferently) that represent the actual ploting of the function in the XoY system. To get the plot of a given function, just modify the Javascript function and adjust the ampliudine(the ampl variable) and the frequency(freq variable).
You can modify the size of the plot by the sizeX, and sizeY variables, and the precission of the plot by incrementing / decrementing (x += 1 for mediocre precision and x += 0.01 for better precision) the variable x in the "draw" function (bigger precission -> more time spent to plot the graph).
That's all :D
